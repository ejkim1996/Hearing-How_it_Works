# Hearing - How it Works

- Created an interactive piece about how different pitches of sounds affects the ear to different depths using a Raspberry Pi.
- Utilized GPIO Zero API to set up the buttons, LEDs, and an LED strip that lit up different lengths per which button was pressed.
- Used the Pygame API to get the different pitches of sounds to play depending on which button was pressed.
